# Core Component: FinancialEntityExtractor Class
Purpose: Extract financial entities from your vector database using multiple detection methods

Key Methods to Implement:

search_qdrant_for_entity() - Search vector DB for documents mentioning target entity

extract_entities_from_text() - Extract entities from individual documents

extract_entities_for_target() - Main method that combines search + extraction

# 🔧 TECHNICAL RESOURCES YOUR AGENT NEEDS
Required Dependencies
bash
uv add qdrant-client spacy networkx pandas numpy
uv add -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Qdrant Integration Pattern
Tell your agent: Use Qdrant's text filtering (not vector similarity) for entity search:

Create Filter with FieldCondition matching entity text

Use dummy vector [0.0] * 768 since you're filtering by text content

Set with_payload=True to get document text back

Entity Detection Methods (Priority Order)
Known Entity Lookup (95% confidence) - Hardcoded dictionary of financial entities

Ticker Pattern Matching (80% confidence) - Regex for stock symbols like "HOOD", "PLTR"

spaCy NER (70% confidence) - Organization entity recognition

Company Suffix Detection (60% confidence) - Words ending in "Inc", "Corp", etc.

# 📊 DATA STRUCTURES YOUR AGENT SHOULD USE
Entity Information Storage
Each extracted entity should track:

canonical_name (official company name)

ticker (stock symbol)

entity_type (BROKER, TECHNOLOGY, etc.)

mention_count (frequency across documents)

document_frequency (number of documents mentioning it)

average_confidence (quality score)

Known Financial Entities Dictionary
Tell your agent: Start with this core dictionary and expand as needed:

Robinhood → HOOD (BROKER)

Palantir → PLTR (TECHNOLOGY)

Tesla → TSLA (AUTOMOTIVE)

Apple → AAPL (TECHNOLOGY)

🎯 VALIDATION STRATEGY
Testing Approach
Tell your agent: Test with these specific scenarios:

Search for "robinhood" - should find Robinhood Markets Inc + related entities

Search for "palantir" - should find Palantir Technologies + related entities

Direct text extraction from sample financial text

Success Metrics
Accuracy: >85% correct entity identification

Coverage: Find 5-10 related entities per target search

Performance: <2 seconds response time

Reliability: Handle missing Qdrant connection gracefully

🔍 WHERE TO GET ACCURATE INFORMATION
Financial Entity Data Sources
Guide your agent to:

SEC EDGAR database - Official company names and tickers

Yahoo Finance API - Current stock symbols and company info

Financial data providers (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud) - Verified entity mappings

NASDAQ/NYSE listings - Authoritative ticker symbols

Entity Recognition Resources
spaCy Documentation - For NER model usage and customization

Financial NLP libraries - FinBERT, BloombergGPT patterns

Regulatory filings - For official company name variations

Qdrant Integration Resources
Qdrant Documentation - Official client usage patterns

Vector database best practices - Filtering and search optimization

Your existing collection schema - Understand your data structure

⚠️ COMMON PROBLEMS TO SOLVE
Entity Ambiguity Issues
Problem: "Apple" could be the company or the fruit
Solution: Use context clues (financial keywords, ticker presence, company suffixes)

Name Variations
Problem: "Robinhood", "Robin Hood", "Robinhood Markets"
Solution: Maintain comprehensive alias lists and normalization logic

False Positives
Problem: Random uppercase words detected as tickers
Solution: Validate against known ticker lists and context

Qdrant Connection Issues
Problem: Database unavailable during development
Solution: Implement mock responses for testing

📈 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
Phase 1: Basic Extraction (Week 1)
Connect to Qdrant - Test basic search functionality

Implement Known Entity Lookup - Start with hardcoded entities

Add Ticker Detection - Regex patterns for stock symbols

Test with Sample Data - Validate extraction accuracy

Phase 2: Enhanced Detection (Week 1-2)
Add spaCy NER - Organization entity recognition

Implement Suffix Detection - Company name patterns

Entity Normalization - Resolve name variations

Confidence Scoring - Rank extraction quality

Phase 3: Optimization (Week 2)
Performance Tuning - Optimize Qdrant queries

Error Handling - Graceful failure management

Result Aggregation - Combine multi-document results

Validation Testing - Comprehensive accuracy testing

🎯 SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR YOUR AGENT
Start Here
Create the project structure with proper directories

Test Qdrant connection with your existing collection

Implement basic entity search for "robinhood" first

Validate results before moving to next feature

Key Decision Points
Entity confidence thresholds - What minimum confidence to accept

Search result limits - How many documents to process per entity

Normalization rules - How to handle entity name variations

Error recovery - What to do when Qdrant is unavailable

Success Validation
Your agent succeeds when:

It extracts "Robinhood Markets Inc" when searching for "robinhood"

It finds related entities (Tesla, Apple, etc.) in the same documents

It handles your actual Qdrant collection structure

It provides confidence scores for each extraction
