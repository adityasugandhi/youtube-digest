# Embedding Model
intfloat/e5-base-v2
## Why this model?
" The e5-base-v2 model is particularly well-suited for financial entity extraction due to its 768-dimensional embeddings that capture semantic relationships effectively. When combined with Qdrant's powerful vector search capabilities, you can identify entity co-occurrences and build meaningful knowledge graphs around financial entities mentioned in transcripts"


# Database
## Qdrant
Qdrant is a vector database that stores and manages vector embeddings. It provides fast and efficient vector search capabilities, making it ideal for applications that require semantic search and similarity-based queries. Qdrant is built on top of the open-source Qdrant vector database and is available as a standalone service or as a part of larger vector database solutions.



# Core Components
## Entity Extraction from Embeddings
Your transcript data stored in Qdrant can be processed using multiple complementary approaches:

### Named Entity Recognition (NER): Use specialized financial NER models to identify company names, stock tickers, and financial instruments from the embedded transcript text. The spaCy library offers excellent support for custom financial entity recognition.

### Pattern-Based Extraction: Implement regex patterns to capture stock ticker symbols, which often follow predictable formats (e.g., "HOOD", "PLTR", "$TSLA"). This method is particularly effective for identifying ticker mentions that might be missed by general NER models.

### Vector Similarity Search: Leverage Qdrant's similarity search to find semantically related content around known entities. When you search for documents containing "Robinhood", you can discover related entities through co-occurrence analysis.

### Types of Financial Entities NER Identifies
Financial NER systems are designed to pinpoint entities that are critical for financial analysis:

#### Company names and stock symbols: These systems can pick up mentions of companies like Apple Inc. or its stock symbol, AAPL. They can even recognize informal references to companies.

#### Financial events: Events like mergers, acquisitions, IPO announcements, earnings reports, and regulatory filings are identified. NER categorizes these by event type and key metrics.

#### Monetary values and financial metrics: The system detects currency amounts (e.g., $2.5 billion), percentages (e.g., 15% growth), and financial ratios. It distinguishes between metrics like revenue, profit margins, and market capitalization.

#### Regulatory documents and compliance entities: NER identifies SEC filings (e.g., 10-K, 8-K), regulatory agencies, and legal entities tied to financial transactions.


### Qdrant Integration Benefits
Qdrant's filterable HNSW index provides significant advantages for financial entity extraction:

#### Metadata Filtering: Filter search results by document type, date ranges, or entity categories during vector search

#### Real-time Updates: Update entity relationships as new transcript data arrives

#### Scalable Search: Handle large volumes of financial transcripts efficiently with sub-linear search times

### Knowledge Graph Construction
The knowledge graph construction process involves several key steps:

#### Entity Standardization: Map variations of company names to canonical forms (e.g., "Robin Hood", "Robinhood Markets", "HOOD" all reference the same entity).

#### Relationship Extraction: Identify relationships between entities based on:

- Co-occurrence in the same transcript segments

- Semantic proximity in the vector space

- Explicit relationship mentions (e.g., "competitor", "partner", "acquired by")

#### Graph Metrics: Calculate centrality measures to identify the most important entities and their influence within the financial network.

## 🎯 Advanced Entity Extraction Concepts

### Multi-Faceted Entity Recognition

**Core Problem:** Financial entities like "Robinhood" aren't disambiguation problems - they're multi-faceted entities with simultaneous aspects that depend on context.

**Key Insight:** Instead of forcing disambiguation (choosing company OR stock), recognize that entities can have multiple active facets based on context clues.

#### Context-Aware Facet Detection

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Context indicators with weighted scoring
CONTEXT_PATTERNS = {
    'COMPANY': {
        'strong': ['earnings', 'revenue', 'ceo', 'announced', 'launched', 'features'],
        'medium': ['company', 'firm', 'corporation', 'inc', 'technologies'], 
        'weak': ['they', 'their', 'it', 'its']
    },
    'STOCK': {
        'strong': ['%', 'price', 'traded', 'bought', 'sold', 'shares', 'volume'],
        'medium': ['up', 'down', 'gained', 'dropped', 'fell', 'rose'],
        'weak': ['stock', 'ticker', 'market', 'investment']
    }
}
```

**Context Strength Calculation:**
- Strong indicators: 0.9 weight
- Medium indicators: 0.6 weight  
- Weak indicators: 0.3 weight
- Maximum score capped at 1.0

#### Multi-Facet Entity Structure

**Enhanced Entity Representation:**
```python
@dataclass
class EntityExtraction:
    text: str
    canonical_name: str
    ticker: Optional[str]
    entity_type: str
    confidence: float
    detection_method: str
    context_facet: Optional[str] = None      # COMPANY, STOCK
    context_strength: float = 0.0            # 0.0-1.0 strength
    unified_entity_key: Optional[str] = None # Groups related facets
```

#### Real-World Examples

**Example 1: Company Context Only**
- Text: "Robinhood announced new cryptocurrency features"
- Result: Single COMPANY facet (context strength: 1.0)
- Indicators: ['announced', 'features']

**Example 2: Mixed Company + Stock Context**  
- Text: "Robinhood is up 8% after beating earnings"
- Result: Both COMPANY and STOCK facets
- Company: strength 0.9 (earnings indicator)
- Stock: strength 1.0 (%, up indicators)

**Example 3: Pure Stock Context**
- Text: "I bought HOOD at $15 and sold at $20"
- Result: STOCK facet only
- Indicators: ['bought', 'sold', '$', 'price']

#### Conflict Resolution Rules

**Priority Hierarchy for Multi-Faceted Entities:**

1. **Facet Coexistence**: Allow multiple facets when context supports both
2. **Context Strength Priority**: Higher context strength wins for same facet type
3. **Unified Entity Grouping**: Link all facets to same canonical entity
4. **Confidence-Based Fallback**: Use confidence scores for tie-breaking

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
def resolve_multi_facet_conflicts(extractions):
    # Group by unified_entity_key
    entity_groups = defaultdict(list)
    for extraction in extractions:
        key = extraction.unified_entity_key or extraction.canonical_name
        entity_groups[key].append(extraction)
    
    # Keep unique facets per entity
    for group in entity_groups.values():
        unique_facets = {}
        for extraction in group:
            facet_key = extraction.context_facet or extraction.entity_type
            if facet_key not in unique_facets:
                unique_facets[facet_key] = extraction
            else:
                # Keep higher context strength
                if extraction.context_strength > unique_facets[facet_key].context_strength:
                    unique_facets[facet_key] = extraction
```

#### Key Benefits

✅ **No Information Loss**: Both company and stock aspects preserved when contextually relevant  
✅ **Context-Driven**: Entity facets determined by surrounding text indicators  
✅ **Scalable**: Works for any multi-faceted financial entity  
✅ **Confidence-Weighted**: Stronger context indicators = higher confidence  
✅ **Unified Tracking**: All facets linked to same canonical entity

#### Common Multi-Faceted Financial Entities

- **Company/Stock**: Robinhood (HOOD), Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL)
- **Company/Person**: Elon Musk (Tesla CEO vs person)
- **Entity/Event**: IPO (company going public vs stock listing event)
- **Product/Company**: iPhone (product) vs Apple Inc (company)

#### When to Use This Approach

**Use Multi-Faceted Recognition When:**
- Entity has multiple distinct aspects in financial contexts
- Context clues indicate simultaneous facets are active
- Different facets require different analysis/handling
- Traditional disambiguation loses important information

**Avoid When:**
- Clear disambiguation is needed (Apple fruit vs Apple Inc)
- Single facet is always appropriate
- Performance requires simplified entity representation

This approach transforms the "Robinhood disambiguation problem" into a more sophisticated multi-faceted entity recognition system that preserves context-dependent information rather than forcing binary choices.
